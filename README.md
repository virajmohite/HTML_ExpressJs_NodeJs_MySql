This is just basic demo made for curiosity that how we can use NodeJs using express and Mysql in web.
To run this sample on localhost use following steps :
	i. Clone this sample with following link https://github.com/virajmohite/HTML_ExpressJs_NodeJs_MySql.git or just simple download the sample.
	ii. Make sure you have installed node onto your device. For confirmation just open cmd in that folder (Hold shift key +   right click) for windows user and type command :$ node -v.
	iii. Then install all node libraries that we would require:
		 a. $ npm install express
		 b. $ npm install mysql
		 c. $ npm install body-parser
	iv. Now come to database database
		import demo_db.sql
	v. Done. :)
	vi. Here we go...now again go to cmd type command : $ node app.js if we get result connected in cmd then open index.html file on browser fill the info we will get result :)
