This is just basic demo has made for curiosity that shows how we can use NodeJs using express and Mysql in web.
To run this sample on localhost use following steps :



	i. Clone this sample with following link https://github.com/virajmohite/HTML_ExpressJs_NodeJs_MySql.git or just simple download the sample.


	ii. Make sure you have installed node onto your device. For confirmation just open cmd in that folder (Hold shift key +   right click) for windows user and type command :$ node -v.


	iii. Then install all node libraries that we would require:
		 a. $ npm install express
		 b. $ npm install mysql
		 c. $ npm install body-parser


	iv. Now come to database part
		import demo_db.sql


	v. Here we go...now again go to cmd type command : $ node app.js if we get result connected in cmd then open index.html file on browser fill the info we will get result :)


	vi. We are done... hopefully :)
